# ArreTest
I will setup a list of all the groups the user is in. There will be a collection having name of the group and all the participants in it. 

We can check whether the user is present in a particular group or not and then allow him to continue or reject. 

But I have implemented a single group where everybody can send messages using their name. 

And the homePage will display all the messages of that one single group.

nodemon app.js will display all the messages. As i was out of time could not finish it

By using run with server option on index.html. You will be able to add your name and message.

I have used MongoDB as database. I have created a database in mongoDB atlas and connected to my project.
